Competition:

~ Challenge: Best Hack for Education: Due to the onslaught of the Coronavirus, education has become significantly
  more difficult as classrooms move online. Edtech is more important than ever. What would make your life as a student
  more efficient? What tech would benefit other students? Create a website or service thatâ€™s useful for education. Note:
  You may want to look into public APIs for educational tech you already use, or start from scratch and create something
  entirely original.
