            When we as students think back to when virtual learning first started, we remember the influx of time in our daily schedules. Being able to learn from home means that we save time. We no longer have to commute to school or spend time walking to our classes. Many of us were unsure of how to use this extra time as efficiently as possible.

            Productively fixes this problem. The user can enter the type of activity they would like to spend their time doing and be given ideas through the website. Examples of activities include picking up a new skill and relaxing.
